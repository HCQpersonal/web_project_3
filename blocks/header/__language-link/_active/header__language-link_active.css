/* Seymon or reviewer, how does CSS actually know when this link is active without pseudoclass
rather than just keeping it in constant state and calling it "active"?
Also, why can't I get it to show up? We were told specifying classes like I had before was ok when needed because of import sequence :(
I've been trying to tag my tutor in Slack but he has not written back :( 
I work full time and am in other courses, so I do not have endless time to research, can you please help guide me? */


.header__language-link_active {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
